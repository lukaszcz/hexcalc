HexCalc is a hexadecimal calculator for Windows. It allows you to see
the results of executing most of the x86 arithmetic instructions,
including the state of the CPU flags. The program was written in
assembler, so you may be sure that each operation you perform in the
calculator corresponds to exactly one x86 instruction.
